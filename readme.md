# CATACOMBS OF CHAOS
By **Elvin Yung**

## Introduction
*Catacombs of Chaos* is both of a) a fully graphical [roguelike](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) dungeon crawler role-playing game engine, and a) a game made with said roguelike engine. I built this with XNA 3.1 in C# back in 2011 or 2012, in a timespan of around two weeks. 

### Stuff in this game
The game is still very much incomplete, and I intend to resume development of this game once I have the time to dedicate towards it. For now, though, it has the following: 
* dynamic tilemap engine
* high-precision collision detection
* custom 4-stat role-playing game system
* fully procedural level and item generation
* modular UI library for game menus and dialogs
