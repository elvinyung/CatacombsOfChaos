# CATACOMBS OF CHAOS
By **Elvin Yung**, 2012

## Introduction
*Catacombs of Chaos*, or prjTileRPG-1, began as the final project for a grade 11 computer science course taken in 2012, which eventually evolved into a casual side project. Basically, it is a fully graphical [roguelike](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) dungeon crawler role-playing game, with procedural level generation and a rudimentary combat system. The bulk of the currently completed parts of the project represents work done within a two-week period in early 2012. Although the specifics of the original assignment only required the use of relatively simple concepts such as loops and arrays, I have utilized this project to experiment with various techniques, including cellular automation and pixel-perfect collision. Because of time constraints and relative inexperience at the time, the style of code in this project remains somewhat expedient, a fact that I hope to change in the future as I continue to make changes to the project.
